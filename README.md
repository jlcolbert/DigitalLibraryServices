# DigitalLibraryServices
My first rotation as the 2017-2019 University of Utah Resident Librarian is in Special Collections and Digital Library Services. In this rotation, I processed the photographs of a local oral history collection.

This repository contains the EAD finding aid as well as the XSL transformation to crosswalk to metadata in the library's SIMP tool for the Digital Library.
